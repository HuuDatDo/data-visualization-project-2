## High-level Goal

Our goal in this project is to develop an interactive application that visualizes machine learning algorithm, aiming to create intuitive representations to leverage the learning experience with machine learning.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to demonstrate the principles and behaviors of machine learning algorithms with visualization. Our target algorithms in this project include, but not limited to, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression.

This project presents an exciting opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired in the Data Visualization course to a real-world application. In addition to demonstrate accurately and clearly the behavior of each algorithm, the quality of the visualization itself is also our crucial target.
