# COMP4010 - Data Visualization - Project 2 - Proposal

**Group G: Dinh Van Thanh, Do Huu Dat, Ha Phuong Thao**

## High-level Goal

Our goal in this project is to develop an interactive application that visualizes machine learning algorithm, aiming to create intuitive representations to leverage the learning experience with machine learning.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to demonstrate the principles and behaviors of machine learning algorithms with visualization. Our target algorithms in this project include, but not limited to, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression.

This project presents an exciting opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired in the Data Visualization course to a real-world application. In addition to demonstrate accurately and clearly the behavior of each algorithm, ensuring the quality of the visualization itself is also our main goal. By leveraging the visualization techniques such as annotation and following the POUR principles while developing application, this application is expected to provide great user-experience and usability to all individuals, including those with disabilities. We also want to see if we can make this visualization tool even more useful by applying it to optimization problems. By using optimization techniques, we hope to create a visual and easy-to-understand explanation of how different optimization algorithms work. This would include showing the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Additionally, we will also try out those aforementioned algorithms in different scenarios such as non-convex functions, handling outliers, etc. In summary, this project will delve into the realm of Machine Learning related algorithms and their behaviors for real-world applications.


By implementing the application with R-shiny, we really hope to bring a great learning experience to user. This R package includes essential modules supporting visualization and interactivity, aiming to provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications.
